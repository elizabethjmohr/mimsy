## mimsy
_calculate dissolved gas concentrations from MIMS signal data without getting a headache_

### Description  
`mimsy` is an R package that calculates dissolved gas concentrations from raw MIMS (Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer, Bay Instruments) signal data based on dissolved gas solubilities. Use the `mimsy` function on a formatted .csv file to return dissolved gas concentrations (mg and Î¼Mole) of N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, Ar based on gas solubility at temperature, pressure, and salinity. Then, easily save the output of `mimsy` to a multi-tab Excel workbook with the `mimsy.save` function. Supports dual-temperature standard calibration for dual-bath MIMS setups.

### Installation  

```R
# Pull package from github using devtools
library(devtools)
install_github("michelleckelly/mimsy", dependencies = "Depends")

# Load package into your R environment
library(mimsy)
```
