Description: The unofficial R package for crunching raw MIMS (Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer, 
    Bay Instruments) day. Use the mimsy function to calculate dissolved gas concentrations and 
	ratios (N2, O2, Ar) based on standard gas solubility at specific temperature, pressure, and salinity. 
	Supports dual-temperature standard calibration, for setups with two water baths. Outputs dissolved 
	gas concentration in units of microM or mg. See Github documentation for import .csv format guidelines 
	and additional details.
