Title: Easily Transform MIMS Signal Data into Concentration Readings with the `mimsy()` Function
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: Michelle Kelly
Maintainer: Michelle Kelly <michellecatherinekelly@gmail.com>
Description: The unofficial R package for crunching raw MIMS (Membrane Inlet Mass 
    Spectrometer, Bay Instruments) signal data, based on gas solubility at 
	saturation. It contains the single function `mimsy`, which will return 
	a list containing a user-friendly dataframe of dissolved gas concentrations 
	(uM and mg) of samples, a dataframe of the calculated gas solubility 
	concentrations at standard temperatures, a dataframe of the calibration 
	factors, a dataframe of the drift correction factors used, and a dataframe 
	of the full results, including interpolated calibration slopes and calculated 
	concentrations of standards. See https://michelleckelly.github.io/mimsy/ for 
	more information, documentation, and examples.
